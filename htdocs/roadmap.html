
<p class="heading1">What we are working on</p>

<p class="heading2f">Documentation</p>
<p class="body">This includes a more comprehensive Quick Start guide and API documentation. Simon Williams made a good start at the latter and it looks like we'll be using <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/">Ndoc</a> to embed the documentation into the actual code.</p>

<p class="heading2">A new SQL generator</p>
<p class="body">With the refactoring of the ER model classes complete we will create a SQL generator based on Velocity templates. The XSL based generator will continue to work as it only depends on the XML format of the model file; which will not be changed.</p>

<p class="heading2">Model Diagrams</p>
<p class="body">Paul is adding a new generator to the tool set that will generate output that can be transformed into an Entity Relationship Diagram using <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Dot</a>.</p>


<p class="heading1">Planned Features</p>

<p class="heading2">Improved qualifiers</p>
<p class="body">Qualifiers that can contain set restrictions. Have a look at the following examples which should be self explanatory:</p>

<p class="code">new TitleAuthorfactory().Find("Title[Royalty > 5000].Publisher.Country = 'Something'");
</p>

<p class="body">Maybe other <a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/ndp/daconopathreference.aspx">OPath</a> features as well.

<p class="heading2">Schema generation for 'legacy' databases</p>
<p class="body">Sometimes you will have the need to retrofit an object layer using Neo to an existing database. In such a case it would be cool to generate either the XML file or the object model from schema information in the database. A first step would be to add Neo support to <a href="http://boss.bekk.no/boss/middlegen/">MiddleGen</a>.</p>
