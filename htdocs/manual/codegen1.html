                Code generation</p>
            <p class="body">When the model is complete, you can start generating code! The Neo 
                code generator takes the model and generates code accoring to two templates: 
                the user class template (<code>NeoClass.vtl</code>) and the support template (<code>NeoSupport.vtl</code>). 
                The class template is used to generate the main entity classes; the support 
                template is used to generate support classes, such as the entity base class and 
                the factory to generate or find entities.
            </p>
            <p class="body">There are two ways to generate the code: The command line utility 
                and the Visual Studio add-in.</p>  
                    
            <p class="heading2">
                The VisualStudio add-in</p>
            <p class="body">The VS add-in is described in a separate document which can be found
            on the <a href="http://neo.codehaus.org/docs.html">documents page</a>.</p> 
            <p class="heading2">
                The command line code generator</p>
              <p class="body">Suppose the model was saved as a file <code>schema.xml</code>, 
                and that the .vtl templates are stored in <code>C:\neo\src\Tools\Generator\Resources</code>, 
                we could then generate the code using the following command:
            </p>
            <pre>
neo.exe /user /support /r C:\neo\src\Tools\Generator\Resources /o out schema.xml</pre>
            <p class="body">
                Let's go over the arguments one by one. The <code>/user</code> argument uses 
                class template to generate a stub user class for you, if it does not exist. If 
                the class already exists, it does nothing. The <code>/support</code> argument 
                uses the support template to generate the support classes. The <code>/r</code> argument 
                determines where the templates are stored. The <code>/o</code> argument sets 
                the directory where the generated files are to be placed; this directory must 
                exist. If you run this command, you will see the following result:
            </p>
            <pre>
Read model; found 2 entities.
Writing out\Title.cs
Writing out\Publisher.cs
Read model; found 2 entities.
Writing out\_Title.cs
Writing out\_Publisher.cs
            </pre>
            <p class="body">
                If you look in the <code>out</code> dir, you will see four files: two for the 
                title entity (<code>Title.cs</code> and <code>_Title.cs</code>), and two for 
                the publisher entity (<code>Publisher.cs</code> and <code>_Publisher.cs</code>).
