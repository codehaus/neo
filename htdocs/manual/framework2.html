                Primary keys</p>
          
            <p class="body">
                Entities must have a primary key, or identity. The title entity, for instance, has 
                the primary key <code>title_id</code>, and publisher has <code>pub_id</code>. For 
                both entities, the primary key is a string which must be provided when you 
                create a new instance using <code>CreateObject</code> on the factory. This is 
                known as the <code>none</code> idMethod just one of four identification methods 
                Neo supports. All id-methods are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>none</code>, where you have to supply the primary key,</li>
                <li>
                    <code>native</code>, where the primary key is generated by the database using 
                    autoincrement functionality (note that this method only works for Microsoft SQL 
                    Server),</li>
                <li>
                    <code>guid</code>, where a <code>Guid</code> is generated by Neo and used as a 
                    primary key.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="body">
                You can define which id-method to use by specifying it with a <code>idMethod</code>
                attribute to the table node in you model file:
            </p>
            <pre>
&lt;table name="titles" idMethod="none" javaName="Title" description="Title (Book) Table"&gt;</pre>
            <p class="body">
                You can also define a global default by specifying a <code>defaultIdMethod</code> on 
                the root database node:
            </p>
            <pre>
&lt;database name="pubs" package="pubs.Model" defaultIdMethod="none"&gt;</pre>
