<p class="body">This project's CVS repository can be checked out through anonymous (pserver) CVS with the following commands. When prompted for a password for anonymous, simply press the Enter key.</p> 

<p class="code">cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.neo.codehaus.org:/scm/neo login</p>
<p class="code">cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.neo.codehaus.org:/scm/neo co neo</p>

<p class="body">Updates from within the module's directory do not need the -d parameter.</p>

<p class="body">The source distributions already contain the required CVS directories. All you need to do to keep up to date after downloading a distribution is to log in using the first command above (once) and then use the following command from within the toplevel neo directory:</p>

<p class="code">cvs -z3 update neo</p>
