<p class="body">Neo is a framework that provides an object facade for ADO.NET to the application developer. It includes tools to create the database schema from the object model and provides rich schema information at runtime allowing it to dynamically generate all SQL required for object persistence management. At the same time, much like ADO.NET DataSets, it is independent of the actual backing store and works equally well with objects transmitted in an XML representation.</p>

<p class="heading1">News</p>

<p class="body">Major news regarding the Neo project. For a detailed list of changes see the <a href="http://cvs.codehaus.org/viewcvs.cgi/neo/ChangeLog?root=neo&view=markup">ChangeLog</a>.</p>

<p class="heading2">17-Jan-2004</p>
<p class="body">A tentative 1.1 release hits the <a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/neo/distributions">distributions directory</a> at The Codehaus. If nobody complains this will be the first public release of Neo. Simultaneously, we have designated the CVS repository on this site as the master repository for Neo.</p>

<p class="heading2">10-Dec-2003</p>
<p class="body">The project will be moving to <a href="http://www.codehaus.org">The Codehaus</a>. SourceForge has been a good home to Neo but I feel that there are a several compelling reasons to move to The Codehaus. It has a real focus on commercially useful projects and has much more of a community spirit. The Codehaus also offers superior services, Jira as a bug-tracker and a wiki for example.</p>

<p class="body">The future of Neo. So far we've been relatively quite about Neo but, nonetheless, an increasing number of people find and use it. Looking at the emails we receive there are two key questions regarding the future of Neo: (1) Why are there so few commits? and (2) what does Microsoft's ObjectSpaces technology mean for the future of Neo? Check out the new <a href="faq.html">FAQ Section</a> for the answers.</p>

<p class="heading2">12-Jun-2003</p>
<p class="body">CodeGeneration is now done within VisualStudio, saving roundtrips to the command line and clutter in the projects. On the runtime side of things, Qualifiers were added, allowing for much more comfortable finding of objects. (However, there are known issues with Qualifiers and SQL generation.)</p>

<p class="heading2">15-May-2003</p>
<p class="body">Tools are now also checked in to the CVS repository on SourceForge. There will be a small restructuring soon but functionality is quite stable.</p>

<p class="heading2">24-Apr-2003</p>
<p class="body">After a period of development behind the scenes, the first version of Neo has made it into the CVS repository on SourceForge. From now on all improvements will be checked in regularly.</p>
<p class="body">This version is by no means feature complete but apart from some minor tweaks it is the basis for the 1.0 release. Unfortunately, the only documentation available so far is a 32 page overview presentation.</p>

<p class="body">Neo is another fine project that originated at <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>. It now moves to SourceForge as the previous NEO project on SourceForge had <a href="moved.html">merged and moved</a> a long time ago, freeing this space for recycling.</p>
