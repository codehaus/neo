<p class="heading1">Is this all?</p>

<p class="body">No, most of the FAQ lives on the <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/NEO/FAQ">Neo Wiki FAQ pages</a>. Note that you are welcome to add new questions to the wiki pages.</p>

<p class="heading1">How do I report bugs?</p>

<p class="body">Please use the <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10377">Jira Issue Tracker</a> to report bugs. This makes it much easier to refer to them from other places. You will have to create an account to report bugs but that only takes a few moments and it allows us to contact you when we have questions regarding the bug you reported.</p>

<p class="heading1">Where are they binaries?</p>

<p class="body">At the moment there are no pre-build binaries. Neo is a developer tool and it is quite easy to build so we didn't consider an installer msi for binaries top priority. There should be one eventually, though.</p>
