<p class="heading1">Is this all?</p>

<p class="body">No, most of the FAQ lives on the <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/NEO/FAQ">Neo Wiki FAQ pages</a>. Note that you are welcome to add new questions to the wiki pages.</p>

<p class="body">The following question remain on this page because they are not releated to the use and development of Neo; and they are quite important.</p>

<p class="heading1">How do I report bugs?</p>

<p class="body">Please use the <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10377">Jira Issue Tracker</a> to report bugs. This makes it much easier to refer to them from other places. You will have to create an account to report bugs but that only takes a few moments and it allows us to contact you when we have questions regarding the bug you reported.</p>

<p class="heading1">What does Microsoft's new ObjectSpaces technology mean for Neo?</p>

<p class="body">Now that ObjectSpaces has been presented and made available to a larger audience it is probably time to address this question.</p>

<p class="body">With ObjectSpaces Microsoft will finally add an object/relation mapping solution to their platform and I think that Luca Bolognese and his team have done a great job designing it. When ObjectSpaces will finally ship, somewhen in late 2004, I see it as the default option. Neo and similar frameworks will be used for certain problem domains and architectures in which ObjectSpaces cannot be used or would be difficult to use. In the case of Neo that would be occasionally-connected systems and interop with components that rely on ADO.NET datasets. Also bear in mind that ObjectSpaces will most likely only support SQL Server databases.</p>

<p class="body">All this means two things for Neo: Development on Neo will continue and some aspects of Neo might be tuned towards the ObjectSpaces design. Neo's query language, for example, is already very similar to OPath; and we'll try to get even closer.</p>
