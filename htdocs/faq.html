<p class="body">I have left the next question on this page, though, as it has been asked a lot and might influence your decision whether you want to give Neo a try.</p>

<p class="heading1">What does Microsoft's new ObjectSpaces technology mean for Neo?</p>

<p class="body">Now that ObjectSpaces has been presented and made available to a larger audience it is probably time to address this question.</p>

<p class="body">With ObjectSpaces Microsoft will finally add an object/relation mapping solution to their platform and I think that Luca Bolognese and his team have done a great job designing it. When ObjectSpaces will finally ship, somewhen in late 2004, I see it as the default option. Neo and similar frameworks will be used for certain problem domains and architectures in which ObjectSpaces cannot be used or would be difficult to use. In the case of Neo that would be occasionally-connected systems and interop with components that rely on ADO.NET datasets. Also bear in mind that ObjectSpaces will most likely only support SQL Server databases.</p>

<p class="body">All this means two things for Neo: Development on Neo will continue and some aspects of Neo might be tuned towards the ObjectSpaces design. Neo's query language, for example, is already very similar to OPath; and we'll try to get even closer.</p>
