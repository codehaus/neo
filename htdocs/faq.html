<p class="heading1">There are so few commits; is Neo still alive?</p>

<p class="body">Yes. Absolutely! The reason for the small number of commits is that some of the development on Neo is happening in the context of a <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a> project. For convenience the team has a revision of Neo in a different source repository at the client site and Jim and I are pushing the code back to The Codehaus every now and then. That said, the repository on this site is considered the master.</p>

<p class="heading1">What does Microsoft's new ObjectSpaces technology mean for Neo?</p>

<p class="body">Now that ObjectSpaces has been presented and made available to a larger audience it is probably time to address this question.</p>

<p class="body">With ObjectSpaces Microsoft will finally add an object/relation mapping solution to their platform and I think that Luca Bolognese and his team have done a great job designing it. When ObjectSpaces will finally ship, somewhen in late 2004, I see it as the default option. Neo and similar frameworks will be used for certain problem domains and architectures in which ObjectSpaces cannot be used or would be difficult to use. In the case of Neo that would be occasionally-connected systems and interop with components that rely on ADO.NET datasets. Also bear in mind that ObjectSpaces will most likely only support SQL Server databases.</p>

<p class="body">All this means two things for Neo: Development on Neo will continue and some aspects of Neo might be tuned towards the ObjectSpaces design. Neo's query language, for example, is already very similar to OPath; and we'll try to get even closer.</p>
